SkinAndBones-Skeleton is an unofficial version of Dave Gamache's Skeleton Framework, based on a stable version of Skeleton 2.0.4

# [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com)
Skeleton is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details.

## Getting started

There are a couple ways to download Skeleton:
- [Download the zip](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/releases/download/2.0.4/Skeleton-2.0.4.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton.git` (Note: this is under active development, so if you're looking for stable and safe, use the zipped download)

## SkinAndBones-Skeleton
SkinAndBones-Skeleton is a template based on the Skeleton boilerplate. It was developed to flesh out the basic boilerplate with common features of a basic website, such as a slideshow and navigation, turning it into more of a UI framework, for use in quickly comping up a functional website.

CSS and JavaScript for various components are added as seperate files so they can be added or deleted as quickly, as necessary.

### What's in the download?

The download includes Skeleton's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```
Skeleton/
├── index.html
├── js/
├── css/
│   ├── normalize.min.css
│   ├── base.css
│   └── skeleton.css
├── fonts/
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico
      ├── icons/
      └── slides

```

### Why it's awesome

The basic Skeleton boilerplate is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.

SkinAndBones-Skeleton adds:
A Better Simple Slideshow
Side navigation with and without multilevel accordion menus
Additional folders to aid in organization
The grid and basic style codes are seperated

## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
